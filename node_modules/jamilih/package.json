String element name (or array of 1-4)\n2. Optional object with attributes\n3. Optional array of text nodes, DOM nodes, and child elements\n4. Optionally repeat for siblings\n\n# Rules (detailed)\n\n1. Last element always the parent (put null if don't want but want to\nreturn) unless only attributes and children (no other elements)\n2. Individual elements (DOM elements or sequences of\nstring[/object/array]) get added to parent first-in, first-added\n3. Arrays indicate children (containing nodes, text (to become text\nnodes) or arrays encapsulating another Jamilih element structure)\n4. Strings indicate elements\n5. Non-DOM-element objects indicate attribute-value pairs\n6. null always indicates a place-holder (only needed in place of\nparent for last argument if want fragment returned)\n7. First item must be an element name (to create an element structure)\n8. Always returns first created element, unless null as last argument,\nin which case, it returns a fragment of all added elements\n\n# Examples\n\nSimple element...\n\n```javascript\nvar input = jml('input');\n```\n\nSimple element with attributes...\n\n```javascript\nvar input = jml('input', {type:'password', id:'my_pass'});\n```\n\nSimple element with just child elements...\n\n```javascript\nvar div = jml('div', [\n    ['p', ['no attributes on the div']]\n]);\n```\n\nSimple element with attributes and child elements...\n\n```javascript\nvar div = jml('div', {'class': 'myClass'}, [\n    ['p', ['Some inner text']],\n    ['p', ['another child paragraph']]\n]);\n```\n\nSimple element with attributes, child elements, and text nodes...\n\n```javascript\nvar div = jml('div', {'class': 'myClass'}, [\n    'text1',\n    ['p', ['Some inner text']],\n    'text3'\n]);\n```\n\nDOM attachment...\n\n```javascript\nvar simpleAttachToParent = jml('hr', document.body);\n```\n\nReturning first element among siblings when appending them to a\nDOM element (API unstable)...\n\n```javascript\nvar firstTr = jml('tr', [\n        ['td', ['row 1 cell 1']],\n        ['td', ['row 1 cell 2']]\n    ],\n    'tr', {className: 'anotherRowSibling'}, [\n        ['td', ['row 2 cell 1']],\n        ['td', ['row 2 cell 2']]\n    ],\n    table\n);\n```\n\nReturning element siblings as an array (API unstable)...\n\n```javascript\nvar trsFragment = jml('tr', [\n        ['td', ['row 1 cell 1']],\n        ['td', ['row 1 cell 2']]\n    ],\n    'tr', {className: 'anotherRowSibling'}, [\n        ['td', ['row 2 cell 1']],\n        ['td', ['row 2 cell 2']]\n    ],\n    null\n);\n```\n\nInclusion of regular DOM elements...\n\n```javascript\nvar div = jml(\n    'div', [\n        $('#DOMChildrenMustBeInArray')[0]\n    ],\n    $('#anotherElementToAddToParent')[0],\n    $('#yetAnotherSiblingToAddToParent')[0],\n    parent\n);\n```\n\nDocument fragments addable anywhere within child elements...\n\n```javascript\njml('div', [\n    'text0',\n    {'#': ['text1', ['span', ['inner text']], 'text2']},\n    'text3'\n])\n```\n\nEvent attachment...\n\n```javascript\nvar input = jml('input', {\n    // Contains events to be added via addEventListener or\n\t//   attachEvent where available\n    $on: {\n        click: [function () {\n            alert('worked1');\n        }\n    }, true] // Capturing\n}});\n```\n\n```javascript\nvar input2 = jml('input', {\n    style: 'position:absolute; left: -1000px;',\n    $on: {\n        click: function () {\n            alert('worked2');\n        },\n        focus: [function () {\n            alert('worked3');\n        }, true]\n    }\n}, document.body);\n```\n\nComments, processing instructions, entities, decimal and hexadecimal\ncharacter references, CDATA sections...\n\n```javascript\nvar div = jml('div', [\n    ['!', 'a comment'],\n    ['?', 'customPI', 'a processing instruction'],\n    ['&', 'copy'],\n    ['#', '1234'],\n    ['#x', 'ab3'],\n    ['![', '&test <CDATA> content']\n]);\n```\n\nNamespace definitions (default or prefixed)...\n\n```javascript\njml('abc', {xmlns:'def'})\n```\n\n```javascript\njml('abc', {xmlns: {'prefix1': 'def', 'prefix2': 'ghi'}})\n```\n\n```javascript\njml('abc', {xmlns: {'prefix1': 'def', 'prefix2': 'ghi', '': 'newdefault'}})\n```\n\nNot yet implemented...\n\n1. Namespaced elements and attributes\n2. Ordered sequences of attributes (or namespace declarations) -\nnecessary for perfect round-tripping (e.g., for diffs) given that\nobject iteration order is not reliable across browser\n\n# Possible todos\n1. Implement a method building JML by string rather than DOM but create\nDOM (including [XPath](https://github.com/goto100/xpath/blob/master/xpath.js))\ninterfaces for direct manipulation.\n1. Allow configuration\n\t1. Allow auto-namespacing of class and/or dataset keys\n\n# Naming\n\nI originally named the project JML (for JavaScript or Json Markup\nLanguage) and have still kept the abbreviation when used as a global\nin a browser (and in the filename and examples), but as other projects\nhave used the name or similar ones, I am renaming the project to\n\"Jamilih\" for the Arabic word meaning \"Beauty\". It is named in honor\nof the Arabic name of my family's newly-born daughter.\n\n# Design goals\n\n1. Be as succinct as possible while being sufficiently functional; avoid\nnull place-holders, etc.\n2. Allow reliable iteration order (i.e., use arrays over objects except\nwhere order is not needed).\n3. Allow for use as a template language, with the opportunity for\nfunction calls to easily add elements, attributes, child content, or\nfragments without needing to retool the entire structure or write\ncomplex functions to handle the merging.\n4. Use a syntax with a minimum of constructs not familiar to XML/HTML\nusers (if any), allowing for near immediate adoption by any web developer.\n5. Work with XML or HTML and optionally support faithful rebuilding of an\nentire XML document\n6. Ability to write libraries which support regular XML needs like XPath\nexpressions (which are more appropriate for HTML than those targeted\nfor open-ended JSON, such as JSONPath). Avoid need to convert to\nDOM where possible (and even implement DOM interfaces for it in a\nmodular fashion).\n7. Work with JSON, but also allow flexible usage within full JavaScript,\nsuch as to allow dropping in DOM nodes or optional DOM mode for\nattachment of events (but with a preference or option toward internal\nstring concatenation for speed).\n8. Be intuitive so that one is not likely to be confused about whether\none is looking at element siblings, children, text, etc.\n\n# Related work\n\nThe only work which comes close to meeting these goals as far as I\nhave been able to find is JsonML. JsonML even does a better job of\ngoal #1 in terms of succinctness than my proposal for Jamilih\n(except that Jamilih can represent empty elements more succinctly). However,\nfor goal #3, I believe Jamilih is slightly more flexible for regular usage\nin templates, and to my personal sensibilities, more clear in goal #8\n(and with a plan for goal #5 and #7?).\n",
